    "text": "The purpose of this website is to share a range of interactive layers related to the geographic HESA (Higher Education Statistics Authority) and Census Data featured in our project. The data shown cumulatively spans between the academic years of 2014/15 and 2023/2024.\nStatistical diversity returns for higher education providers in England and Wales have been broken down into academic and non-academic classifications.\nTypically used to calculate ecological diversity, the Shannon-Weaver Index (SWI) scoring approach is applied to ethnic classifications as captured by the 2021 census (Equation 1). This same process is also applied to calculate diversity within higher education institutions using the available HESA classifications.\n\\[\nH' = \\sum_i p_i log_b p_i\n\\tag{1}\\]\nHere, \\(p_i\\) refers to the proportional abundance of a species, and \\(b\\) is the base for the logarithm - in this experiment it is the natural logarithm.\nOverall, the relationship between regional diversity (Census) and institutional diversity (HESA) is strongly positive, with a correlation coefficient (Pearson’s \\(r\\)) of 0.624, and Spearman’s Rho (\\(\\rho\\)) of 0.64."
